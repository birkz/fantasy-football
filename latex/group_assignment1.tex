% Description of the project
\section{Project plan}
In this document there's the project plan for group F2a. Group members are: Einar Helgi Þrastarson (personal ID number: 110287-2919), Hannes Pétur Eggertsson (240889-2939) and Sigurður Birkir Sigurðsson (120589-2539). The project involves creating an UI for a fantasy football game. The presenter for this planning on Wednesday will be Einar Helgi.

\section{Conclusion}
Our iterations are 14 days long.
Subtracting Saturdays (2 days) and other school homework(5 days) leaves $\approx 7$ days. Of those, only 70\%, i.e. $7 \cdot 0.7 =$ \textbf{5 productive days} can actually be used for the project. We are 3 people on the team, so we can fit at most $5 \cdot 3 =$ \textbf{15 person-days} into an iteration.

So according to our planning we should be able to barely finish the user stories within iteration 1 \& 2 where we plan that they take around \textbf{14 days} where we plan to have about \textbf{15 days} to finish them. In iteration 3 we will spend roughly half of the time implementing the user stories and the other half in integration.
